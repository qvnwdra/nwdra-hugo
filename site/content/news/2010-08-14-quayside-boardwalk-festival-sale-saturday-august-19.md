**<span style="font-family:sans-serif;">EVENT HOSTS</span>**  
Originated by the QUAYSIDE COMMUNITY BOARD
([Quaysideboard.com](http://quaysideboard.com/)), the BOARDWALK festival
& sale is pleased to welcome DOWNTOWN New Westminster BIA and their many
merchants. The QCB is the largest residential board association
representing over 2080 members.  
  
**LOCATION**  
Just off Quayside Drive along the Promenade (Boardwalk) beside the
mighty Fraser River in the City of New Westminster. Over 5000 people are
expected to stroll more than a kilometer along the Boardwalk from
Reliance Court to the new River Market and further on to Hyack Spirit
Square and up historical Columbia Street.  
  
**DAY & TIME**  
Saturday, August 21st, 2010 10am to 3pm -- Rain or Shine!  
  
**THE PURPOSE**  
First, it is an event for family and friends to be together and enjoy an
incredible day of shopping, recycling, fun, festivities, eating and so
much more.  
  
Second, the Boardwalk festival and sale is the largest recycling event
in the lower mainland. The theme for this event is Recycle, Refill,
Reuse and RESELL! 150 tables will display an abundance of quality goods
for sale ranging from Kitchen items, Furniture, Books, Clothes, Sport
Goods, Technology, Antiques, Collectibles and a plethora of bric-a-brac
items. Items bound for new homes not destined for landfills.  
  
Third, raising awareness of social issues such as Cancer (Run For The
Cure For Breast Cancer), as well as monies for charities and
not-for-profit organizations, is a critical component of this events
history and future. Be sure to bring a few extra dollars for the Raffles
and Hot Dogs for charity, as well as a can or box of non-perishables for
the Food Bank.
