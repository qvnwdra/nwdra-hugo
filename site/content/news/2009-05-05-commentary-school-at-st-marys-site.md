(The following was emailed to the New Westminster School District in
support of an elementary school being built on the old St. Mary's
Hospital site.)  
  
I am a downtown New Westminster resident. I have lived in New West for 7
years. I have, by choice driven my daughter to Connaught Heights school
for her primary and intermediate schooling. I found the school to be a
lovely little corner of the community, and I hope that the school will
remain open as a community centre, pre-school etc... That being said,
the neighbourhood is small, and I understand the need to re-allocate
resources.  
  
I want to register my support for the elementary school at the St Mary's
site. I think it is a tremendous solution. The land is not in use, there
will be no park land destroyed in order to accommodate the school. It
will also give a much needed elementary school for all the babies and
toddlers I see about our neighbourhood. The downtown core is growing at
a tremendous rate, several new buildings going up on Columbia @ New West
Skytrain, and plans for another at Columbia at 4th. Downtown is a lovely
but largely misunderstood area of New West, please, let's continue to
make the downtown core a neighbourhood desirable to families.
