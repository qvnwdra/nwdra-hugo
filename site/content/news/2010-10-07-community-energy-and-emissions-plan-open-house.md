New Westminster is committed to building a sustainable community and has
recently initiated the development of a Community Energy and Emissions
Plan (CEEP). The CEEP will outline a strategy for the community to
increase our energy efficiency, diversify our energy supply, reduce
waste and reduce our impact on global climate change. In order to reduce
our community's energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, we need
help to develop actions and policies that impact how our community will
grow and develop over the next 25 years.  
  
The City has collected information on our current community energy
consumption and emissions levels and would like to share with you what
we've learned at an Open House on <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Tuesday, October 12, 2010 from 5:00 pm â€“ 7:00
pm</span> in the foyer of City Hall, located at 511 Royal Avenue.  
  
Come and share your thoughts on how our community can reduce our energy
consumption and emissions and grow in a greener, cleaner way! If you
have any questions please contact Engineering at 604-515-3780.
