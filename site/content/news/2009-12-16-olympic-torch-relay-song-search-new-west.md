Hello 150th Anniversary Volunteers,  
  
My name is Jay Young and I’m the Chairperson of the New Westminster
Olympic Torch Relay Committee. Jennifer Peyton has graciously allowed me
to e-mail you and let you know about a few things regarding the arrival
of the torch to New Westminster. We hope you will be inspired to
participate and let others know about these great opportunities!  
  

1.  February 9, 2010 – is when the Torch will visit the Royal City with
    our Community Celebration taking place in Queen’s Park at 10:15 am.
2.  Volunteers Needed – If you are interested in volunteering for this
    event please contact our Volunteer Coordinator Shelly Schnee at
    <sschnee@newwestcity.ca>
3.  Song Search New West – To generate community spirit ahead of the
    Olympic Torch’s arrival in New Westminster on February 9, 2010, a
    song writing contest is underway. It’s open to all New
    Westminster residents. Judges include Graham Wardle from CBC’s
    Heartland and New Westminster resident and music producer
    Don McLeod. Don is also the co-founder of the School Alliance of
    Student Songwriters (SASS), a program currently running at New
    Westminster Secondary. Prizes include a professional recording
    session and a chance to perform your song at the Torch Relay
    Community Celebration in Queen’s Park on February 9. The contest
    closes on January 11 and the winner will be announced January 18. To
    submit your self- produced video first upload it to youtube and
    then, cut and paste the link to the 'submit' page on
    [www.songsearchnewwest.com](http://www.songsearchnewwest.com/)
4.  Team Challenge - Not to distract you songwriters and performers from
    writing and performing your new song for submission to Song Search
    New West, but rather, just for added fun, why not take the team
    challenge? Your sports team or your co-workers may want to take the
    Team Challenge as laid out by the Hyack Football team. What is it?
    Teams and groups of any kind are challenged to sing the chorus to
    the newly written song 'Carry the Flame' better than the football
    team! That’s the team challenge!
