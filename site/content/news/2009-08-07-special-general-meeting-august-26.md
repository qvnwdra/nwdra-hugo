Wednesday, August 26, 2009  
7:30 pm  
Holy Trinity Cathedral â€“ Parish Hall  
514 Carnarvon Street  
New Westminster  
  
Please note the change of time to 7:30.  
  
Stephen Scheving has agreed to speak to us about the <span
style="font-weight: bold;">rezoning</span> for the <span
style="font-weight: bold;">St. Mary's site</span> to allow for an
elementary school and park, and the <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Westminster Pier site</span> for a park and
amenities. The later time is to allow Stephen to get there as he has a
prior engagement.  
  
The city has requested that we submit our thoughts and opinions on these
two matters by noon Tuesday, September 8 for the Public Hearing on the
Westminster Pier site on September 14, and by August 28th for the
St.Mary's site for inclusion in a report to Council. Our next regularly
scheduled meeting is not until the AGM on September 23rd, after both
deadlines.
