<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">New Westminster
Parks, Culture and Recreation invites you to sample the **new outdoor
sand courts** at the Westminster Pier Park. The courts, located at the
eastern end of the park (also known as the Timber Wharf), are now
available for use by the general public on a first come/first served
basis.</span>  
  
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Poles and nets
will be provided and users will be required to supply their own
volleyballs. Volleyballs can be rented at the Westminster Pier Square
concession (Concession Hotline [604-527-4634 ext
4](tel:604-527-4634%20ext%204)) and at Fraser River Bike Tours at the
River Market
[http://www.fraserriverbiketours.com](http://www.fraserriverbiketours.com/).</span>  
  
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">On **Saturday,
September 7, from 9:30am-12:30pm** (rain or shine), Parks, Culture and
Recreation staff will be on hand to introduce this new amenity and sport
to the community. With casual games for children and families on one
court, and high level instruction for youth and adults on the next,
everyone will have a chance to play. Play with local beach volleyball
champion, Mike Sayers, who just brought home a silver medal from the
World Beach Volleyball Championships in Torino, Italy. Balls will be
provided during this event and concession services will be open for
extended hours from 9:30 am - 7:00 pm. </span>  
  
<span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">Public feedback
on the sand courts and other park activities is welcomed and encouraged.
