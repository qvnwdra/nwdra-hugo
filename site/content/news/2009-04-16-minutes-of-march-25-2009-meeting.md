Petula gave a short presentation and fielded audience questions
regarding the film industry and film shooting in the downtown area.  
  
Guest Speaker: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Travis Johnson</span>,
Vancouver Circus School.  
  
Johnson gave a lively presentation on the second location of the Circus
School at the River Market at Westminster Quay. Currently on a short-
term lease at the Market, the Circus School offers a variety of classes;
i.e.,  
trampoline, juggling, swinging trapeze, open to all ages. The public is
encouraged to come for a “look-see” on Tuesday and Thursday evenings
from 7 – 9 pm. Johnson is hoping to secure a long-term lease once an
anchor tenant is secured at the Market.  
  
Guest Speaker: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reena Meijer</span>-
Drees, on electoral reform and STV.  
  
Meijer-Drees spoke on the Single Transferable Vote and the structure and
mechanics of it. The STV will come up as a referendum question in the
May 12 provincial election. Meijer-Drees explained that with the STV the
number of MP’s won’t change though it could mean a minority or coalition
government. With STV, votes won’t be wasted. If passed in the May
election perhaps the STV will be enacted in the next provincial election
in 2013. A lively question and answer period followed the
presentation.
