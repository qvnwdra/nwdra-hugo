The [Save the Burr Coalition](http://www.savetheburr.com) cordially
invites you to a public form regarding the intended sale of the Burr
Theatre.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial;">Wednesday,
September 30, 7:30pm - 9:00pm</span>  
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial;"> Galbraith House,
131 - 8th Street</span>  
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial;"> New
Westminster</span>  
  
Recently the local press has published articles stating that the City
intends to sell the Burr and has issued a Request for Proposals ("RFP")
to that effect.  
  
The coalition is proposing that the Burr Theatre remain a City-owned
facility and be developed as a multidisciplinary arts facility on
Columbia Street (see the [Vision
Statement](http://www.savetheburr.com/main/vision_statement.pdf)). This
will promote arts and culture in New Westminster and correspondingly
will be a boost to business and tourism.  
  
The coalition values your knowledge and experience and would appreciate
your attendance. To help planning and arrange for the refreshments,
please RSVP either by email, or by phone: 604-525-3244.
