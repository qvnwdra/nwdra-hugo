MARK SHIH, MIA CIRIC and BLAZENKA VOJKOVIC of RIVER MARKET. Mark brought
us up to date on the work being done at the Market, from the exterior
painting (including the Tin Soldier), mechanical and electrical upgrades
and a new roof, basically rebuilding the “bones” of the Market. Shih’s
vision for the Market includes it being a food related destination on
the first floor, with a good variety of food providers anchored by a
major tenant still unsecured. The second floor would consist of offices
and business, possibly health care oriented. The historic murals of the
former Quay have been returned to New Westminster City Hall and the
Museum and Archives. The clock tower will be removed, possibly to be
replaced by a wind mill. We are all invited to keep in touch and follow
the development.
