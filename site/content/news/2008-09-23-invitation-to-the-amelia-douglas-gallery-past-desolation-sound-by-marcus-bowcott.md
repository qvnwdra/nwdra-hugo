Artist</span>  
  
"The subjects I depict are usually man made structures such as
scaffolds, ships, airplanes and automobiles - things that are extensions
of our bodies in space. The forms of these structures tell of our human
aspirations and intentions, and hint of our senses of exhilaration and
limitation (and feelings of longing and loss). The context of the
imagery is usually drawn from places I've worked: Industrial spaces,
ship anchorages and booming grounds. An expansive, surrounding space is
a deliberate aspect of this work. I want to convey a sense of place in
relation to my own personal sense of internal, felt subjectivity. If
there is an overriding theme in this work it is about the traces humans
leave in nature."
