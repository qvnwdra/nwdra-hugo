Subject: \[NWEP\] Cosmetic Pesticide Open House  
Hello NWEPers,  
  
Please see the following announcement from the City about the Cosmetic
Pesticide by-law. We encourage as many of you as possible to come out to
the open house and make your voices hear to have this by-law implemented
sooner rather then in 2 years as proposed.  
  
There could be an amnesty phase where the by-law is in effect but not
enforced. This at least gives a large stick to the city to use if there
are any residents using anti-social amounts of pesticides.  
  
Cheers.

The City of New Westminster is taking steps to reduce the amount of
chemicals that enter the natural environment from the use of pesticides.
A Pesticide Use bylaw has been drafted and we want to know what you
think about it.

You’re invited to an Open House on February 4, 2009 to review and
discuss the draft version of the City’s Pesticide Use Bylaw. We would
like your input on this regulation which was developed to reduce the
non-essential (cosmetic) use of pesticides within the City of New
Westminster. A proposed education approach will also be discussed. Staff
will be in attendance to provide information, and to receive your
comments and input. For more information, please call the Engineering  
Department at 604-527-4592.
