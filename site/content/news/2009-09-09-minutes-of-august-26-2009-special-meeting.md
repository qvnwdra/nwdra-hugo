GUEST INTRODUCTION  
James Crosty, President of the Quayside Community Board, spoke about the
Quayside Community Board, how it is structured and how the Board and the
Downtown Residents Association could work together co-operatively. A
lively question and answer period ensued.  
  
GUEST SPEAKER STEPHEN SCHEVING, PLANNING CONSULTANT, CITY OF NEW
WESTMINSTER  
  
Stephen gave two interesting presentations on proposed developments in
the City.  
  
The Westminster Pier site is a narrow strip of land stretching along the
waterfront from the foot of Elliot Street to the foot of Sixth Street. A
public park is planned for this site, currently zoned residential, and
requiring rezoning to public park and amenities before any development
can proceed. The property is presently in derelict and environmentally
dangerous condition and will require considerable clean-up and
restoration.  
  
The second presentation concerned the redevelopment of the old St.
Mary’s Hospital site. A primary school and small park are planned for
this location. Our input and concerns are requested and forms for this
purpose were handed out, due to be returned to the City by 4:30 on
August 28th.  
  
After a lengthy question and answer session it was MOVED, SECONDED AND
CARRIED in favour of supporting the necessary By-Law and OCP changes to
allow these two projects to move forward and a letter to that effect
sent to the City.  
  
MEETING ADJOURNED: 9:05 PM
