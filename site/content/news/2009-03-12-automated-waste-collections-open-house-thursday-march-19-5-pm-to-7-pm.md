The City is proposing to move to an automated collection system for
garbage and clean green waste for all single family residences. On
Thursday, March 19th, Engineering Operations will host an Open House in
the foyer of City Hall to acquire feedback from residents with respect
to the proposed program.  
  
We welcome as many as possible to drop in for an informative session on
the proposed Automated Waste Collections, complete with interactive
displays, refreshments, and a draw for prizes!
