New Westminster Museum and Archives is undertaking a **gallery
redevelopment**. The purpose of the museum is to tell our City’s story
in a manner that best connects with our visitors, supports Parks,
Culture & Recreation’s comprehensive planning and encourages the
community to feel at home in their museum. We are seeking new ideas and
a progressive outlook so we can create interesting and dynamic exhibits.
What can we do to accomplish this? What would make you visit your
museum?</span>

Residents are encouraged to provide their ideas on future exhibitions
and programming and assist us in understanding what stimulates curiosity
and inspiration. Join us at this visioning workshop and help us share
the story of New Westminster’s rich history.</span>
