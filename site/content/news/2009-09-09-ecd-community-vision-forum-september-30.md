The Early Childhood Development (ECD) Committee is creating a vision for
New Westminster and would like your participation in this process. The
committee wants Early Childhood Development to be inclusive, connected
and well-informed, with families who are supported and have access to
the services they need, and with programs, agencies, organizations and
businesses that work together.  
  
This forum is being held to inform, to ask for feedback about how to
make neighbourhoods more liveable for families with young children, and
to enlist the assistance of the community at large in carrying out the
action plans.  
  
Background information is available
[here](http://docs.google.com/View?id=dc6j7sqd_85d2w5vz4t).
