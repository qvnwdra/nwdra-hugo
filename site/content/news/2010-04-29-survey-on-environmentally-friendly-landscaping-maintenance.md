A message from United Community Services Co-op:  
  
A local non-profit in New Westminster is currently conducting research
on the viability of operating an environmentally friendly landscaping
maintenance business.  
  
They have been operating a landscaping social enterprise for the last 12
years employing people with developmental disabilities and due to an
increasing amount of requests from existing and potential customers
regarding the environmental impact of their services, they are
considering expanding their service to include environmentally friendly
landscaping maintenance. They are interested in getting feedback from a
variety of potential customers regarding their ability and/or interest
in using this service.  
  
They have prepared a short online survey and would be pleased to hear
from you.  The survey is confidential and will only be used for the
purposes of determining whether there is a market for this service.  
  
Please click here to access the survey:

Your input will be very valuable in evaluating the feasibility of this
enterprise. Thank you very much for your time. If you have any
questions, please contact Barbora at 604.718.8292.
