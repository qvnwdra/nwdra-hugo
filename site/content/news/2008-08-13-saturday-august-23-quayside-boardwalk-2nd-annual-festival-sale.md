and incredible music weren’t enough to make the QUAYSIDE BOARDWALK
Festival & Sale a fun family destination – then the fact that there will
be meat grilled to perfection on the BBQ, raffles prizes, balloons and
face-painting for the children, and a little something uber special for
your prized pooch or poochette can only mean that it is a must-attend
affair!

YOUR NEST & DIMPLESKINS have pooled their talents to bring you the
outrageous PAWDICURES. Yep, bring your canine to their booth and get a

ladies that brought you the Friday Night Fireworks during Hyack Fraser
Fest 08, and have created this SPA for DOGS especially for the QCB and
those attending the QUAYSIDE BOARDWALK Festival & Sale.
