The Western Canada Society to Access Justice (Access Justice), Pro Bono
Law of BC and the Access Pro Bono Society of BC present the Ride for
Justice on Sunday, May 16, 2010. The event is organized to raise
awareness about the free legal services available to residents in B.C.
and to support the pro bono consultations and community services
provided through Access Pro Bono. It features a bike ride and
presentations/ panels discussions led by practicing lawyers and social
justice advocates in the community. This is the 3rd year that Access
Justice is running the public outreach event.  
  
The concept for the event was inspired by the organization’s founder,
Dugald Christie, who tirelessly advocated for reforms to B.C.’s justice
system. Dugald paired his quest to make the legal system accessible to
individuals in all income brackets with his love of cycling, undertaking
cross-Canada rides to raise awareness about justice issues.  
  
“The image of a lawyer in robes on a bicycle heading to a courthouse
says a great deal about how Access Justice wants to keep the courts and
the justice system firmly within the reach of ordinary Canadians,” says
Society Director Phil Dougan.  
  
The event starts at 10:00 a.m. and wraps up at around 12:30 a.m. Riders
will rally in front of the New Westminster Court House building at 668
Carnarvon Street and then bike to Queen's Park.
