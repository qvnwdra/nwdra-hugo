Here is a notice from the New Westminster Police Service:  
  
File: 2009-22460  
  
The New Westminster Police Service seeks the public’s assistance to
locate Bongani NYONI, a Thirty-Eight year old New Westminster resident,
who has now been charged with three counts of Aggravated Sexual Assault
after having sexual intercourse with three women while knowing he was
HIV positive.  
  
New Westminster Crown Counsel has issued a Canada wide warrant for
NYONI’s arrest as it is believed he may have travelled to eastern
Canada. The offences date back to May of 2006 and investigators are
concerned that NYONI may continue to engage in intimate relations with
females without disclosing his medical condition.  
  
Investigators are seeking any information from the public that could
assist them in determining NYONI’s location.  
  
Contact: Sergeant G. Weishaar
