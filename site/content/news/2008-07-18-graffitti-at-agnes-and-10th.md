<span style="font-size:130%;">Just informing you of graffiti located on
the south east corner of the electrical substation located at Agnes
Street and 10th Avenue. The presence of graffiti that is not removed
within 48 Hours is known to cause an increase in the amount of crime to
the areas affected. There is also Graffiti located on the Skytrain
support pole in the center of Columbia Street at Tenth Avenue behind the
left turn signal onto 10th heading east on Columbia. This graffiti is
small but has been there for years. The area near the buildings I help
to manage has been the focus of a neighborhood cleanup that should
include this graffiti removal. I appreciate you taking the time to help
with the association and hope that you will forward this info to the
appropriate persons.  
  
Thank you,
