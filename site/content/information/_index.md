    The Downtown Residents Association is an organization for residents
    of New Westminster between Royal Avenue and the Fraser.  We have regular
    meetings to discuss local initiatives, meet our neighbours, hear interesting 
    guest speakers and express our concerns and ideas for creating a safer, more 
    liveable community.
