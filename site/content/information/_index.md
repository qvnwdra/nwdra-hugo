    TOGETHER OUR VOICE IS STRONG! 
    Attend a meeting - there is no charge to participate. 
    If you decide to join, the fee is $5.00/year, and gives 
    you a vote, in addition to your voice. You will also then 
    be eligible to run for office as a NWDRA Board Member, or 
    join a Committee. 

    There are internal committees for various 
    concerns and events. We presently have members on City Committees, 
    including Traffic Advisory, Community Policing, and the Homeless Coalition.
