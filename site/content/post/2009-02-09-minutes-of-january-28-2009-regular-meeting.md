NEW WESTMINSTER DOWNTOWN RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION  
Regular Meeeting January 28, 2009  
  
  
Chairperson: Lila Wood  
Recorder: Miriam Smith  
  
Call to Order: 7:02 pm in the Lounge of the Parish Hall, Holy Trinity
Cathedral with 21 people in attendance.  
  
Directors present: Andrew Boyd, Barb Elliott, Judy Ross, Miriam Smith,
Jonathan Story, Lila Wood.  
  
Moved, Seconded, Carried: To approve the Agenda, Minutes of November
Meeting and Treasurer's Report.  
  
Guest Speaker: Mark Shih, owner of Riverside Market at the Quay.  
Shih updated us on events at the Riverside Market, formerly the Quay
Market, now partially closed for perhaps 8 -10 months for renovations.
Riva Cafe, Laguna Blue and the Sushi restaurants, the Paddlewheeler Pub
and Liquor Store, and Imperial Pharmacy will remain open during
renovations. Shih's vision for the new market would be as a "food
destination" with a major food tenant as the anchor. So far no tenant
has been secured. The financing is still in limbo. What money is
currently available is being used for electrical and mechanical
upgrades. A Circus School is using the upper level to offer classes on
Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Hyack Square work should be completed as
of May, 2009, opening the stairway access to the market again.  
  
Guest Speakers: Lisa Spitale, Director of Planning, and Eric
Westerberg,  
City Planner.  
Spitale walked us through the Downtown Community Plan. About 800 members
of the public have been involved in the consulting process for this  
plan. Issues that concern us the most in the Downtown area are: density
bonuses, the North Fraser Perimeter Road, the push for encapsulation of
the railway and truck route, and the future of the parkade. Predicted
growth figures for the downtown area indicate that we will increase our
prominence. Perhaps the downtown will be viewed in terms of "precincts"
- unique neighbourhoods zoned on an individual basis. No decision has
been made re the 60 million dollars of casino revenue available for a
"multi-use civic facility".  
  
Committee Reports:  
  
Homelessness Coalition: Toque Tuesday will be held on February 3rd  
to raise funds. Upcoming "Housing Stands" will be held on Saturday,
February 21st and Saturday, March 21st from 1:00 to 2:00 pm at the
corner of 6th Avenue and 6th Street. We are all encouraged to take
part.  
  
Traffic Advisory Committee: No report as the next meeting is tomorrow,
January 29th.  
  
Community Policing: No December meeting. At the January meeting  
the issues over snow removal from sidewalks was discussed. It was agreed
that the recent snow falls were not cleared in a timely manner by a
number of downtown businesses and suggested that the by-law for removal
by 10 am should be enforced.  
  
Royal City Farmers Market: The Market A.G.M. was held on Thursday,
January 22nd. Most vendors from 2008 will return for the 2009 season.  
  
New Business  
  
A call for new members for the Community Barbecue and Festival Committee
did not bring forth any volunteers. The Committee will continue with the
present members.  
  
Next Meeting: Wednesday, March 25, 2009, at 7:00 pm in the Lounge of the
Parish Hall at Holy Trinity Cathedral.  
  
Meeting adjourned at 9:05 pm.
