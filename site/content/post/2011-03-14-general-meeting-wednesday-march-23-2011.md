New Business  

What do we want to do in 2012 to replace our Barbecue?  
We have outgrown our present event. Do we want to keep the idea and
limit the number of tickets? Do we want a new location and something new
and bigger and better? Should we join with Quayside and/or BIA for a
larger event? Bring your ideas.
