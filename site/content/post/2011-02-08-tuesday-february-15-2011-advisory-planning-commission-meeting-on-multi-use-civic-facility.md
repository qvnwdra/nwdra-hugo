The City of New Westminster is proposing to rezone 777 Columbia Street
from Columbia Street Historic Comprehensive Development Business
District (C-8) to Comprehensive Development District (Multi Use Civic
Facility) (CD-35) in order to enable the development of a Multi Use
Civic Facility and office tower. The Multi Use Facility would be located
in the lower 60 feet of the building in three storeys plus mezzanine.
The office tower, which would be up to 8 storeys in height, would be
located on the westerly side of the site. The total development would
have a maximum floor space ratio of 7.0 and a height of 220 feet. A
liquor primary license is part of the application.  
  
The Advisory Planning Commission will consider this proposal on Tuesday,
February 15, 2011, at 6:30 pm in Committee Room \#2 at City Hall.
Written submissions should be sent by Friday, February 11.  
  
For more information on this proposal, please phone Development Services
