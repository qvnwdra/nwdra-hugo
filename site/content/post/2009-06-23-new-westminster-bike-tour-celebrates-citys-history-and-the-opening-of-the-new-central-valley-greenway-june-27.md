The much anticipated Central Valley Greenway (CVG) will be officially
opened on Saturday June 27th. As part of this event, and to celebrate
the 150th Birthday of the City of New Westminster, the New Westminster
members of the Vancouver Area Cycling Coalition will be leading an
historical theme bike tour from Hyack Square, along the CVG, to the
official opening at the new overpass at Winston and Sperling in
Burnaby.  
  
The total length of the tour will be 13 km at a leisurely pace and is
suitable for novice riders and above. Participants are asked to gather
(with helmets) at 9:30 am at Hyack Square. Prior to departure the riders
will be able to examine the City's 150th anniversary display which
celebrates the history of the oldest city in western Canada, and coffee
and refreshments will be available to everyone getting ready for the
ride. The tour will be accompanied by Rob McCullough, the curator of the
New Westminster Museum at Irving House. Rob will provide an historical
narative as we travel along the CVG which passes through the historic
heart of New Westminster.  
  
The Central Valley Greenway in New Westminster is an ideal new route for
novice and experienced cyclists to parallel the Fraser River safely and
comfortably along well-marked bike lanes, quiet, residential streets,
and separated greenway paths. The route connects the New Westminster
Quay in the City's urban and historic downtown to Sapperton and Hume
Park.  
  
The route passes near many venues of interest to cyclists, including
cafes, pubs and restaurants, provides stunning vistas of the river and
mountains, and allows riders to connect with nature and recreation in
the Brunette River Valley. The CVG is regionally accessible from several
SkyTrain stations which can serve as staging or terminating points for
day trips. The CVG continues westward through central Burnaby to
Vancouver-Science World connecting with the Seawall to False Creek and
Stanley Park. Within New Westminster the CVG offers connections to the
BC Parkway, the Crosstown Greenway and other City bike routes. The CVG
can be used by commuters, recreational riders and anyone who'd like to
see and enjoy our City and region at the pace of a bicycle.  
  
The VACC-New Westminster invites everyone to come out and celebrate the
opening of this amazing new transportational and recreational facility
in MetroVancouver.
