REMINDER: Green Drinks in New Westminster this Wednesday, June 3rd  
  
Drop by New Westminster's monthly Green Drinks Sustainability Discussion
at [<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Heritage
Grill</span>](http://www.theheritagegrill.com) in the newly renovated
Back Room!  
  
Green Drinks is a monthly gathering of sustainability professionals and
others who are interested in discussing environmental and sustainability
issues over their favorite drink, whether that be a  
pint of beer, fruit smoothie or Green Drink! The Green Drinks movement
began in the UK in 1989 and over the years has spread worldwide, coming
to Canada in 2005.  
  
Originally oriented towards just environmental professionals,
participants now also represent all ages, backgrounds and group
affiliations, including non-profit organizations, academia,
government,  
small business, big business, the self-employed, volunteers, students,
concerned citizens... and everything in between.  
  
There's no agenda or formality at the gatherings – only the opportunity
to meet to chat, debate, socialize and connect with others in the
Burnaby/New Westminster, Tri-Cities and Surrey areas who are passionate
about environmental and sustainability issues. Whether the subject is  
green buildings, sustainable energy, organic gardening, or something
else entirely, participants are likely to find some expertise in the
room.  
  
New Westminster Green Drinks are held every 1st Wednesday of the month
at  
[The Heritage Grill](http://www.theheritagegrill.com/)  
447 Columbia Street, New Westminster  
  
5:45–8 p.m.  
  
The Heritage Grill is half a block from the Columbia Skytrain Station,
with bike racks nearby for cyclists.
