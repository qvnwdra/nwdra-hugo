> Hi there, my name is Todd Arbuthnot, I’m the general manager of 57
> Below Pub and Liquor Store. Barry Waite from the city has asked me to
> get in touch with you to discuss our plan to move the 57 Liquor Store
> from its current location at 57 Blackie St, to the new mall being
> built next door to us, Plaza 88 (888 Carnarvon St). What I’m asking
> for is support for our relocation, or if your association has any
> input regarding the proposed move. I’m not sure how you would like to
> handle this, phone call, face to face, or just email?  
> Our plan calls for us shutting down our current space and moving into
> the main floor of the mall, adjacent to Safeway. Our store would be a
> 3500sq/ft full service liquor store. We would offer a full selection
> of wines, spirits, beer, and cooler/ciders. We would be a 7 day a week
> operation like now, with the same hours. We currently run 4 liquor
> stores in the lower mainland, and would direct you to our website,
> www.tagpubs.com for you to see the types of stores and pubs we
> operate. I look forward to working with you and any comments you have
> regarding our proposed application. Thank you, Todd
