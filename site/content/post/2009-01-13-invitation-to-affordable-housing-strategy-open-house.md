Dear Community Member:  
Re: Draft Affordable Housing Strategy – Presentation and Open House  
  
Access to safe, adequate and affordable housing is fundamental to the
physical, economic and social well-being of individuals, families and
communities.  
  
The City’s current Housing Strategy (1996) has served as an important
policy tool; however, conditions relating to housing affordability have
changed significantly over the past 13 years. As a result, the City of
New Westminster is currently in the process of creating a new <span
style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Affordable Housing
Strategy</span>.  
  

> How can the City of New Westminster best work towards being an
> inclusive city where residents live in safe, appropriate and
> affordable housing and where there are housing choices for people of
> all ages and abilities?

  
A draft strategy that deals with these issues is ready for review, and
we would like your input and feedback at our Open House on <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Thursday, January 29, 2009</span> <span
style="font-weight: bold;">from 5:00 – 8:00</span> at Century House, 620
Eighth Street, New Westminster. There will be a presentation at 7:00. A
[copy of the draft strategy is
available](http://www.newwestcity.ca/cityhall/dev_services/neighbourhood_planning/Affordable%20Housing/index.htm)
on the City’s website under the Development Services link.  
  
To help meet space requirements, please RSVP to Kathleen Stevens at
604.527.4656 or kstevens@newwestcity.ca with your name, telephone number
and/or email address.  
  
If you have any questions about the Open House or the Affordable Housing
Strategy, please contact Lil Ronalds, Planner, at 604.527.4653 or
lronalds@newwestcity.ca.  
  
Yours very truly,  
Lisa Spitale  
Director of Development Services
