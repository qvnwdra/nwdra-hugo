The Planning Division will be hosting a Workshop and Open House for the
next phase of the Downtown Community Plan. We will be seeking public
feedback on growth management assumptions, land use options, urban
design guidelines, heritage principles and density bonusing. Previous
work on the Plan can be found on the webpage at
