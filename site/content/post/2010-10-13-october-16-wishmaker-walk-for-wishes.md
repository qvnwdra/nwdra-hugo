<span
style="font-family: &quot;Archer Medium&quot;; font-size: 11pt;">On
October 16<sup>th</sup>, 2010, we put feet on New West’s streets with
the 6<sup>th</sup> Annual Children’s Wish Foundation’s “Wishmaker Walk
for Wishes!”  </span>  
<span
style="font-family: &quot;Archer Medium&quot;; font-size: 11pt;">Registration
will take place at the Heritage Grill on the corner of Columbia and
Church Street at 11 am and the walk will start at 12 pm.</span>  
  
<span
style="font-family: &quot;Archer Medium&quot;; font-size: 11pt;">This no
barrier, fun filled, national event raises funds for children between
the ages of 3 and 17 who are suffering from life-threatening
illnesses, </span><span class="Apple-style-span"
style="font-family: 'Archer Medium'; font-size: 15px;">so they may
experience a brighter day and have a smile in their heart.  The
Children’s Wish Foundation has taken on this mission since
1984,</span>  
<span
style="font-family: &quot;Archer Medium&quot;; font-size: 11pt;">yet
there is still so much work to do.</span>  
  
<span
style="font-family: &quot;Archer Medium&quot;; font-size: 11pt;">For the
past 5 years, the Wishmaker Walk for Wishes has taken place in
Vancouver, however, seeing that New Westminster is fast becoming
a </span><span class="Apple-style-span"
style="font-family: 'Archer Medium'; font-size: 15px;">vibrant, walkable
community, it was time to get out on the streets and shine!  Also, a
first for any city, New Westminster’s Walk for Wishes will </span><span
class="Apple-style-span"
style="font-family: 'Archer Medium'; font-size: 15px;">feature a
pre-Halloween “Trick or Treat” with tremendous support from the local
business community.  Kids of all ages will experience
candy, </span><span class="Apple-style-span"
style="font-family: 'Archer Medium'; font-size: 15px;">treats and hot
chocolate at various stops along their route.  There will also be
exciting performances at Hyack Spirit Square by the </span><span
class="Apple-style-span"
style="font-family: 'Archer Medium'; font-size: 15px;">Vancouver Circus
School and local rock and blues band Foster Child.</span>  
  
<span
style="font-family: &quot;Archer Medium&quot;; font-size: 11pt;">We can
all win, with your support in raising funds and helping us show that New
Westminster is a healthy, vibrant community.   Please
support </span><span class="Apple-style-span"
style="font-family: 'Archer Medium'; font-size: 15px;">us by joining the
Wishmaker Walk for Wishes on October 16<sup>th</sup>, 2010.  It would be
wonderful to see your team out on the street showing the </span><span
class="Apple-style-span"
style="font-family: 'Archer Medium'; font-size: 15px;">community that we
have a healthy Downtown New Westminster and that it has a heart
too.</span>  
  
<span
style="font-family: &quot;Archer Medium&quot;; font-size: 11pt;">We look
forward to seeing you there, thank-you for your support!</span>
