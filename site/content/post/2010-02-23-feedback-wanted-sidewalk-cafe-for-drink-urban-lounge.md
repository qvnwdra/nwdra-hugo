<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:arial;">We have been
asked to support Drink Urban Lounge's application for a sidewalk cafe
type set-up on Columbia Street in front of their Lounge next to
Starbucks.  
  
Their plans include an enclosure with flower baskets and attractive
furniture, similar to but not the same as Heritage Grill, Sherlock's and
Aldo's patios. If you have any objections to this, please email me
(</span>[<span class="Apple-style-span"
style="font-family:arial;">lilawood@shaw.ca</span>](mailto:lilawood@shaw.ca)<span
class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family:arial;">) by Sunday evening
or I will presume that you approve or have no opinion. My personal
opinion is that this will add life to the street in the same way that
the other three patios do, and we do need life on Columbia Street.  
  
Deadline for submission to the City is Monday, March 1. Thanks.  
  
Lila Wood</span>
