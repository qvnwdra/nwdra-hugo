Dear Residents' Association:  
  
Re: 607 Columbia Street, New Westminster, BC  
  
An application has been received to relocate a Liquor Primary License to
609 Columbia Street (legal address: 607 Columbia Street) (shown hatched
in black on the sketch plan attached). The applicant proposes to operate
a lounge with an occupant load of up to 88 people. The City has already
reviewed the application and indicated support to the Liquor Control and
Licensing Branch. The City is now moving forward with the processing of
the application to amend the New Westminster Zoning Bylaw in order to
allow a Liquor Primary Licensed Premises at this location.  
  
Is is the policy of the Advisory Planning Commission to notify property
owners in the immediate area of a site proposed for rezoning. Your
opinion on this matter would be appreciated. You may submit your views
in writing or, if you require further information, you are invited to
attend the Advisory Planning Commission meeting on Tuesday, February 17,
2009 at 6:30 p.m. in Committee Room \#2 at City Hall, 511 Royal Avenue.
In order for correspondence to receive full consideration by the
Advisory Planning Commission, we would encourage that all written
submissions be submitted the Friday prior to the meeting.  
  
Further information on this proposal may be obtained by phoning
Development Services - Planning at 604-527-4532.  
  
For your information, a brochure outlinining the Commission's role and
meeting procedures is enclosed.  
  
Yours truly,
