<span style="font-weight: bold;">"Be a Part of History!"</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">  
World Poetry New Westminster</span> is offering three free poetry
workshops at the <span style="font-style: italic;">New Westminster
Museum and Archives</span>.  
  
The purpose of these workshops is to create a series of historical poems
for display in celebration of our city's 150th anniversary. Each
workshop will include a brief historical presentation on New Westminster
by Museum Curator, Rob McCullough, a complementary tour of Irving House
and a poetry reading of New Westminster's Poet Emeritus Don Benson's by
his wife Evelyn.  
  
Ariadne Sawyer will then lead you in creating your own poem that fits
into New Westminster's historic timeline. You will focus on Poetic
forms, editing and performance tips. Ariadne is the co-founder and
co-host of the <span style="font-style: italic;">World Poetry Reading
Series</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">World Poetry New
Westminster</span>, and the <span style="font-style: italic;">World
Poetry Cafe Radio Show</span>. She specializes in poetry workshops as a
means of creative expression.  
  
Registration is required due to limited space, 604-527-4640. This
program is a partnership between the <span
