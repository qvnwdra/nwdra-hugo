**<span

General Meeting Canceled</span>**  
**<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">To be replaced by
special "election" meeting to be held in October.</span>**  
<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">  
</span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Due to the
typical slowing down of general business in the summer months, the board
has decided to cancel the July general meeting this year, and instead to
hold a special "election" meeting in October where we hope to have all
the candidates in attendance to offer them an opportunity to speak to
the downtown community.</span>  
<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">  
</span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">The next
scheduled meeting will be our **Annual General Meeting on Wednesday,
September 24, 2014.**</span>  
<span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">  
</span><span style="font-family: Trebuchet MS, sans-serif;">Happy
Summer!</span>
