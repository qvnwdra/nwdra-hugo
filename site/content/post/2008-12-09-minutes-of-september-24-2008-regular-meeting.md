NEW WESTMINSTER DOWNTOWN RESIDENTS ASSOCIATION  
November 26, 2008  
  
  
The meeting was called to order at 7:12 pm in the Lounge of the Parish
Hall of Holy Trinity Cathedral with 14 persons in attendance.  
  
Chairperson: Lila Wood, Recorder: Miriam Smith.  
Directors present: Judy Ross, Miriam Smith, Jonathan Story, Lila Wood.  
  
M/S/C To approve the Agenda, Minutes and Treasurers Report as
circulated.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial;">Guest Speaker:
Acting Mayor Bill Harper, New Westminster City Council member.</span>  
  
Mr. Harper reported on the outcomes of the Open House workshop and the
Design Charette held in September in regard to the Downtown Community
Plan. He then went over the new council’s vision for the proposed
changes and improvements that will affect the downtown area. We all want
to maintain a liveable, walkable city and to promote sustainable
development. We have to deal with ongoing issues of homelessness, lack
of child care facilities and an aging infrastructure. The city has no
reserve fund for amenities. Development cost charge money will go for
this purpose.  
  
Harper fielded questions and concerns from the audience regarding a
variety of issues including homelessness, new and ongoing development,
Westminster Quay Market, etc.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: arial;">Guest Speaker: Sue
MacPhail, Canadian Cancer Society.</span>  
  
Sue spoke regarding the use of cosmetic or non-essential pesticides,  
herbicides and fungicides and their harmful side effects on children,
pets and farmers. They are also harmful to bees, frogs and fish, and can
contaminate drinking water. Some stores, including Home Depot, Canadian
Tire and Rona are removing these products from their shelves. We should
work to eliminate their usage, particularly those that contain 24D.  
  
At this point we decided to draft a motion:  
M/S/C “Therefore be it resolved that the New Westminster Downtown
Residents Association support the passing of a cosmetic pesticide by-law
by the City Council of New Westminster”
