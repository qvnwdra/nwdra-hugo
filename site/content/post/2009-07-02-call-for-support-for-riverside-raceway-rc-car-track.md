We are a remote control car club that resides in New Westminster at 420
Wood street. We use this location in New Westminster for the past four
years. We are a family oriented place for members, guests and spectators
to come and enjoy the hobby of remote control off-road car racing. It
has been a great place for kids,teenagers,adults and families to come
out and spend constructive time. It gives a lot of youth chances to
interact with others and build confidence. We raise all our own funding
through our members and club racing.  
  
We have started a petition to show the support of a facility like ours
and the no cost to the city good it does in the community. We also have
a lot of surrounding areas come to use the facility. We do generate some
income for New Westminster by having members and visitors purchase food,
supplies, building materials and use hotels for out of town racers on
big events.  
  
If you would like to help us show support for the track please visit the
link below and let others know about it.
