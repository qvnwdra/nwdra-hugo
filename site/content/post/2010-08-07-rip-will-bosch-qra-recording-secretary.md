On Monday, August 2, 2010, Will Bosch, Recording Secretary for the
Queensborough Residents Association, while walking on the Queensborough
Bridge collapsed mid-span. Efforts to revive him were partially
successful, but damage from lack of oxygen to his brain was extensive
and he died soon after being taken off life support on Thursday.  
  
He was well-known for his contributions to the community and will be
sorely missed.
