Metro Vancouver’s Regional Growth Strategy (Metro Vancouver 2040:
Shaping Our Future) is a framework to guide the future development of
our region to 2040. It is a shared commitment by Metro Vancouver and
member municipalities to work together to achieve regional goals. The
Regional Growth Strategy is an important tool for managing future growth
in the region, while still ensuring its livability. Following the
adoption of the new Regional Growth Strategy, New Westminster’s Official
Community Plan will need to be reviewed to take into account the new
regional policies.

for New Westminster residents and the business community to learn about
the draft Regional Growth Strategy and provide comments on the growth
projections:
