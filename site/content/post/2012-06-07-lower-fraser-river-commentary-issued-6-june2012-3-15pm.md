**<span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">New Westminster,
BC</span>**<span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"> – The City
of New Westminster would like to provide the following update to
residents regarding the water levels on the Fraser River, received from
the BC River Forecast Centre as of</span> <span
style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">June 6, 2012.</span>  
<span style="font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;">  
</span>

<span lang="EN-CA">Over the past week, air temperatures have been
cooling throughout the Fraser River basin.  A minor precipitation event
from June 1 to 2 has created a slight increase for flows on the Fraser
River at the Water Survey of Canada gauge at Hope.  Flows peaked mid-day
Wednesday, June 6 and will decrease gradually over the following two
days.  Flows should bottom out mid-day Friday before increasing
significantly over the weekend and into next week in response to a
weather system currently affecting the upper reaches of the Fraser
River.  It generally takes 3 – 4 days for increased flows to move from
the headwaters of the Fraser River to the Lower Fraser Valley.</span>

  

<span lang="EN-CA">Currently, a large-scale upper low pressure system is
significantly affecting the Upper Fraser, Thompson and Cariboo
regions.   Most mid to high elevation snow stations still measure 60 to
90% of their total snow remaining.  The heavy rain could enhance the
melting rate of the snowpack. River levels at Hope will begin increasing
on the weekend.  They are expected to reach their highest levels of the
freshet so far early next week.</span>

  

<span lang="EN-CA">Uncertainty over the flow forecast is largely due to
the unsettled weather trend and the resulting amount of rain that
falls.  Wetter than expected conditions may lead to higher than forecast
flows.  There are currently no signs of significant hot spells forecast
in the next 7  days. </span>
