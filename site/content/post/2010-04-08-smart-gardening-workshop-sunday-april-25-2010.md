New Westminster’s Pesticide Use Bylaw comes into effect this year on
March 1, 2010. This bylaw restricts the use of pesticides for cosmetic
(non-essential) purposes in maintaining outdoor plants.

Learn how to maintain your garden and lawn organically at this new City
workshop!

We are offering this excellent workshop once again to those that were
unable to make the one in March. Come with your questions, note pad and
pen. Celebrate Earth Day weekend with us!

Date: Sunday, April 25, 2010  
Time: 1:15 – 4:15 pm  
Where: New Westminster Public Library (auditorium)

There is no charge to attend, but we ask that you please register in
advance if you wish to participate. To register online [click
