Media Release  
  
November 6, 2008  
  
New Westminster Environmental Partners (NWEP), a local environmental
organization, has completed a detailed survey for the mayoral and city
councillor candidates for the upcoming municipal election in New
Westminster. The survey focussed on questions in four areas which will
have a profound impact on the current and future livability of the City.
Well-conceived decisions in these areas can have a significant influence
on the ability to develop a sustainable City and a City which is a role
model for our region. The survey invited the candidates to share their
vision and ideas on key issues affecting the City and it queried their
support for some specific ideas which are of interest to NWEP members.  
  
This survey aims to promote a discussion amongst the candidates and the
public in four areas:  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">1. Land Use and Amenities</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">How can development be managed in the
City while creating a better place for existing and future
residents?</span>  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">2. The Environment</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">How can environmental stewardship be
fostered within the City, and what is the City’s role in the region, and
the world?</span>  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">3. Transportation</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">As the hub of the region, what kind of
transportation solutions can work for the City and region and can the
City be a leader in promoting these solutions?</span>  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;">4. Social Issues</span>  
<span style="font-style: italic;">Can the City be more inclusive for all
its residents?</span>  
  
“These are important issues in New Westminster that have significant
connections with the sustainability and livability of the City”, says
Beth Rogers, a spokesperson for NWEP. The comments, opinions and
responses of the candidates are posted on the NWEP website at
<http://nwep.ca/content/2008-municipal-election-survey-results> and will
be available for the remainder of the 2008 election campaign.
