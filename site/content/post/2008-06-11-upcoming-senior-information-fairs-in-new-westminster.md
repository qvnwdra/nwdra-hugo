Subject: Senior Information Fairs in New Westminster  
  
Hello,  
I am the Event Planner for a trio of information fairs being held for  
seniors in New Westminster. I am writing for a few reasons:  
1. To provide you and your organization with details of the upcoming
events  
in our community (described below my signature)  
  
2. To ask you to help identify seniors in your neighbourhood who might
need  
transportation or a companion to make it possible for them to attend  
  
3. To ask your members to consider volunteering for the events, possibly
to  
accompany or drive a senior (or seniors) from your neighbourhood so they
can  
attend the event. Other event assistance would also be welcomed.  
  
4. To ask you to consider local service providers or businesses that
provide  
senior-friendly services (delivery, discounts, etc.) who might want to
have  
a presence at the fair(s).  
  
I greatly appreciate your sharing this information within your
organization.  
Please email or call with any questions, to volunteer, or to provide
names  
of people who might need help to attend.  
  
Many thanks for your consideration,  
  
Mariam Larson, IMBY Event Planner  
Gerontologist & Consultant

people  
can access services.

educate attendees.

games, entertainment and speakers, and food.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;"> EVENT FUNDING</span>: Provided in part
by a grant to Seniors Services Society from  
UBCM (Union of BC Municipalities). The City of New Westminster is also  
supporting these fairs. There is a research component, to develop a  
community database of senior resources.
