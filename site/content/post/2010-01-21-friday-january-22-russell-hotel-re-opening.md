open at 740 Carnarvon Street, New Westminster.  
  
The Russell Hotel was built in 1908 for businessman Elijah J. Fader as a
place for travellers, as well as for local social and business
occasions. Also known as the College Place Hotel, the Russell has been
converted into social housing, with 40 supportive units and 15 shelter
beds.
