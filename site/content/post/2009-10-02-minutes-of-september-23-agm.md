<span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:arial;">Chairperson’s
Report</span>  
  
Lila reflected on a busy year - many celebrations for the 150th a
anniversary of New Westminster as well as the completion of Hyack Square
and the ongoing renovations being done at the River Market. We look
forward to a new park at Westminster Pier as well as a new elementary
school at the old St. Mary’s Hospital site. Our 9th Annual Community
Barbecue and Street Festival was another summer success – held on a
really hot July day. Thanks to all: the City; Parks, Culture and
Recreation Department; Jim Luu and the Catering Department; Genesis
House staff and residents; and to all the volunteers – well done!  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:arial;">Guest Speaker: Mayor
Wayne Wright, City of New Westminster</span>  
  
Mayor Wright spoke on all the ”Happenings” in the downtown area – Plaza
88, Hyack Square, River Market, Westminster Pier and the school
scheduled to be built on the St. Mary’s site.  
  
The question of the future of The Burr Theatre was brought up. What will
happen? Will the City take this on? The possibility oof the Massey
Theatre closing may make the viability of The Burr even more
attractive.  
  
The Royal City Star casino boat remains unsold with no interested
buyers. The Larco site has remained undeveloped – what will happen
there? The face of the downtown will continue to change. After the Mayor
spoke a lively “Q & A” period followed.

<span style="font-style: italic;">Community Policing Committee</span>  
Lila Wood reporting. The last meeting dealt with the Queens Park area
and trouble with youth in the park at night drinking, nuisance
behaviour, damage to cars, and noise. The Parks crew have cut back trees
and bushes around the nuisance areas, allowing more light and
visibility. This appears to have lessened the problem. The police have
also been talking to the  
parents to get their cooperation in controlling the problem
activities.  
  
<span style="font-weight: bold;font-family:arial;">New Business</span>  
  
City Budget surveys on line and some copies available for those not on
email. The City wants our opinions on the priority items for City
